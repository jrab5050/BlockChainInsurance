Verifiers invest principle amount into insurance 

Verifiers process all transactions in the network

As a reward, the verifier recives a precentage of the total monthly fees of the networks subs

Subs pay a fixed monthly charge for a certain policy for a fixed period of time.

The protocal must manage:

- How many subs may join the network, depedent on total principle amount invested by the verifiers
- Punishments for verifiers who do not process transactions, or verifiers who are transmating false transactions
- Rewards for verifiers
- Sub placement for verifiers
